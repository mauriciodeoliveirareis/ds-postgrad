Step 1. Download the zip file from Brightspace that contains the datafiles we are using this week.
Unzip to a location that makes sense for you and make sure you know how to access the data from
within RStudio.
Step 2. Review the markdown (and HTML output generated from this).
Step 3: Using the Survey.data dataset (dataset on well-being) build a logistic regression model to
predict the probability of being in the category of smoking or not smoking (variable smoke 1 = yes; 2
= no) with the predictors of gender (variable sex) and total perceived stress (tpstress)
To make life easy – you can start with a single predictor
 Check the model against the assumptions of logistic regression.
Step 4: Extend your model by including another predictor if you get time.

### SETUP

```{r}
#We are using a .sav file created from the SPSS file survey.sav  taken from SPSS Survival Manual 6th Edition Julie Pallant. This has been saved to a .dat format - more easily readable in R.
#http://spss.allenandunwin.com.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/data-files.html#.Wb0vvnWP-po
#Results on a survey on well being
#We need to load the file so that we can use it in R.


survey <- read.table("survey.dat")


#Setting the column names to be that used in the dataset but in lowercase to make life a bit easier
colnames(survey) <- tolower(colnames(survey))
#Remember to install this packages if you haven't already done so
library(tidyverse) #For creating histograms with more detail than plot

```

### FROM LECTURE
### CORRELATION
#### Scatterplot
```{r}

#Simple scatterplot of feeling of control and perceived stress
#aes(x,y)
scatter <- ggplot(survey, aes(tpstress, tpcoiss))
scatter + geom_point() + labs(x = "Total Perceived Stress", y = "Total PCOISS") 

#Add a regression line
scatter + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "Red", se = F) + labs(x = "Total Perceived Stress", y = "Total PCOISS") 

#Note: When running this in RStudio the output will appear un the Plots tab on the right hand side, if not visible click the Plots tab
```

#### Conducting Correlation Tests - Pearson, Spearman, Kendall
 
```{r}

#Pearson Correlation
stats::cor.test(survey$tpcoiss, survey$tpstress, method='pearson')

#Spearman Correlation
#Change the method to be spearman.
#This test will give an error since this method uses ranking but cannot handle ties but that is ok with us - we consider this to be missing data
cor.test(survey$tpcoiss, survey$tpstress, method = "spearman")

#We can also use kendall's tau which does handle ties
cor.test(survey$tpcoiss, survey$tpstress, method = "kendall")
```

    "The **R** language was originally aimed at statisticians, so you might find it works a little differently to the more developer-oriented languages you're used to. It's well worth investing the time to get comfortable with R, though; it's a very fast and easy-to-use programming language which will let you knock out visualisations and data-exploration scripts in next to no time. *Please read all the notebook running one cell at a time so that you can confirm that you understood the respective explanation.*\n",

    "### Numeric Data Types\n",
    "Numeric data types can be further broken down into **integer** and **double** types. As with Python, integers are whole numbers with no decimal components. Doubles are R's equivalent to Python's float. R considers numeric values to be *doubles* by default (statisticians almost always end up with decimal places), if you specifically want an integer value you can add the **L** suffix (capital L) to the end of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "*aside:* this convention stems from the fact that R uses 64 bits rather than 32 bits to store an integer, the largest integer you can write is thus 2^64. C uses 32 bits by default to store an integer and the larger-capacity 64-bit equivalent is referred to as a *Long*. Similarly, numbers with decimals are referred to as *floats* in C (floating point refers to the fact that the decimal can be in different positions within the number). Floats are represented with 32-bits, whereas a larger capacity 64-bit floating-point number is known as a *double*"
